# Adyen Payment plugin for Magento
Use Adyen's plugin for Magento to offer frictionless payments online, in-app, and in-store.

## Integration
The plugin integrates card component(Secured Fields) using Classic integration for all card payments. Local/redirect payment methods are integrated with DirectoryLookup and HPP. For Point Of Sale (POS) payments we use Terminal API using Cloud-based communication. Boleto, MultiBanco and SEPA are a direct API integration into Adyen.

## Requirements
The plugin supports the Magento Community (version 1.8 and higher) and Enterprise edition (version 1.13 and higher). 
For Magento 2.x please use the following plugin: [https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-magento2](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-magento2)

## Setup Cron
Make sure that your Magento cron is running every minute. We are using a cronjob to process the notifications, our webhook service. The cronjob will be executed every minute. It only executes the notifications that have been received at least 5 minutes ago. This is to ensure that Magento has created the order, and all save after events are executed. A handy tool to get insight into your cronjobs is AOE scheduler. You can download this tool through <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AOEpeople/Aoe_Scheduler/releases">GitHub</a>.

## Caching / Varnish configuration
